This plugin hides the Library of design sets in Oxygen & also access to the code block. (if you're wanting to give clients access to builder and need to remove these things)

Note: I'm not recommending giving clients access to Oxygen builder. This plugin was created because somebody was asking how to do it in the [Oxygen Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1626639680763454/), it can be used to simply learn how to hide unwanted items in the builder.
